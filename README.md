# 📱 Mobile Simulation & Testing Environment (AVD)
**Precision Environment Configuration for Android Engineering**

This repository documents the specialized Android Virtual Device (AVD) configurations used to stress-test and validate mobile applications, specifically the **Gated Community Security Suite**.

## 🛠️ Environment Specifications
To ensure high performance and security, my testing lab utilizes the following configurations:
* **Device Profiles:** Pixel 7 Pro & Nexus 5X (for screen density and aspect ratio validation).
* **System Images:** API 34 (Android 13.0) and API 30 (Android 11.0) for cross-version compatibility.
* **Hardware Acceleration:** x86_64 ABI with Multi-Core CPU emulation to simulate high-traffic data processing.

## 🧪 Testing Focus
I utilize these AVDs to perform:
1. **Network Simulation:** Testing SQL synchronization latency between the mobile client and the MySQL backend.
2. **Resource Monitoring:** Analyzing CPU/RAM usage during peak visitor logging simulations.
3. **UI/UX Rigidity:** Ensuring the **Java-based interface** remains responsive under heavy SDK-level tasks.

## 🚀 Connection to SCM & Distributed Systems
By documenting these environments, I ensure that my **Software Configuration Management (SCM)** workflow remains consistent across different development machines.
